Review the code you just wrote and simplify it:

**Remove over-engineering:**
- Inline abstractions used only once
- Remove wrapper functions that just call another function
- Replace config objects with constants
- Keep three similar lines over a premature abstraction

**Reduce complexity:**
- Flatten nesting with early returns
- Remove unused code, variables, imports
- Simplify conditionals

**Improve clarity:**
- Rename unclear identifiers
- Split multi-purpose functions
- Delete comments that restate code
